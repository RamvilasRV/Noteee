# Noteee
This is a simple and minimal notepad. This was made using python tkinter. Has a very minimalist look and only works using keyboard bindings.

Keybindings :-

Open existing file -> Ctrl-o <h/>
Clear the screen -> Alt-c
Save file -> Ctrl-s  
Quit -> Ctrl-q


To get the minimize/ maximize and close buttons (default) at the top, edit the code from
> root.overrideredirect(1)
to
> root.overrideredirect(0)
